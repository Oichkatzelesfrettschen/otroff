AT&T PWB/UNIX troff (1977-1978)
===============================

This repository contains the source code for the historical `troff` typesetter
from AT&T's PWB/UNIX distribution.  The files under `croff/`, `neqn/`, `roff/`
and `tbl/` were extracted from the following archive preserved by The Unix
Heritage Society:

    http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/usdl/bostic_pwb.tar.gz

No explicit license accompanied the original distribution.  The code is
provided here for historical reference and may remain subject to whatever
terms applied to AT&T software at the time.  Use at your own discretion.

Only the build helpers in this repository (e.g. `Makefile`, `setup.sh`, and
other top‑level files) were added; the sources in the subdirectories are
unmodified.
